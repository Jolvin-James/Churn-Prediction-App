# Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

A Streamlit-based dashboard that predicts customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave a service) using a pre‚Äëtrained machine learning model, and provides interactive visual insights into customer behavior.

## üßæ Input Features & Their Relevance to Churn

| Column              | Description                                                               | Relevance to Churn                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age**             | The age of the customer in years.                                         | Older or younger customers may show different loyalty or usage patterns.            |
| **Gender**          | Encoded as `0` (Female) and `1` (Male).                                   | Captures demographic trends; often less predictive but useful for segmentation.     |
| **Tenure**          | How many months the customer has been with the company.                   | Shorter tenure often correlates with higher churn (weaker relationship).            |
| **Usage Frequency** | Number of times the service is used per month.                            | Very low or very high usage can signal dissatisfaction or dependency.               |
| **Support Calls**   | Number of support calls made in the last 30 days.                         | More calls often indicate unresolved issues and frustration, raising churn risk.    |
| **Payment Delay**   | Average delay (in days) in making payments.                               | Consistent delays point to disengagement or financial difficulties.                 |
| **Subscription Type** | Service tier encoded as: <br>`0 = Basic`<br>`1 = Premium`<br>`2 = Standard` | Certain tiers may churn more if perceived value does not match cost.                |
| **Contract Length** | Contract type encoded as: <br>`0 = Annual`<br>`1 = Monthly`<br>`2 = Quarterly` | Longer contracts typically reduce churn due to customer commitment.                 |
| **Total Spend**     | Total amount of money spent by the customer.                              | Low spenders may be casual users; high spenders expect high satisfaction.           |
| **Last Interaction**| Days since the customer last used the service.                            | Longer inactivity suggests disengagement and higher churn probability.              |
| **Churn**           | Target variable: <br>`1 = Yes` (churned) <br>`0 = No` (retained)           | The outcome the model is trained to predict.                                        |
